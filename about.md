My work also extends into data support for marketing through performance marketing campaign analysis, web analytics in GA4, and GTM settings. Moreover, as a Ph.D. candidate at Charles University in Prague, I combine rigorous research methods with practical applications in governance, focusing on regulation as a policy instrument. I use a mix research methods design, integrating both qualitative and quantitative approaches to enrich the research process. I also spent a year as a visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Denver, focusing on the impacts of regulation in drug policy.</p>
